**Why**
If you create trading software - this lib is probably for you. If you like to make custom indicators and think out of the box - this lib is most likely for you. And if you miss usability of TradingView.com in other open-source libraries and can't stand it - you are definetly in the right place!

Scrolling & zooming as we all like
Simple API for making new overlays
Custom drawing tools
Non-time based charts (e.g. Renko)
One overlay === one .vue component
Fully reactive
Fully responsive
Customizable colors and fonts
Quite fast (works even with 3 mil candles)
Scripts (make your own indicators)
